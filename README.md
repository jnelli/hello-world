# hello-world
Hello, GitHub!


I'm an aspiring web developer with formal training in animation and practical experience in project management. What turned into me dabbling with HTML and CSS for an online visual arts portfolio ended up with me on the learning trajectory to become a professional web dev. I love visual design, crossword puzzles, hiking, and taking care of my cats and snakes.

This repository is simply a playground to familiarize myself with Git and deploying static website. Don't mind the mess! :)
